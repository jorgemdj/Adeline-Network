# Adeline-Network
This program is a practical project related to Chapter 4 of the book 'Artificial Neural Networks for Engineering and Applied Sciences: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Aspects.' (https://laips.sel.eesc.usp.br/)

It presents a simple configuration approach for an artificial neural network.

The adeline network belongs to the single-layer feedforward architecture, as the flow of information in its structure always resides from the input layer towards the output layer. But now, it utilizes the error between the activation potencial and expected value to ajust the weighs W[i].
